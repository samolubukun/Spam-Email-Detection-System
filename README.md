### Spam Email Classification Project

This project involves the development of a spam email classifier using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms. 
The dataset used for training and testing is the 190k Spam-Ham Email Dataset, which consists of over 190,000 labeled email messages (Spam and Ham). 
The dataset is preprocessed with techniques such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stop word removal to prepare the text for feature extraction.
